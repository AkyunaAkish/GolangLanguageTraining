# Concurrency and Parallelism

```
Concurrency is the composition of independently
executing processes, while parallelism is the 
simultaneous execution of (possibly related) computations.
Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.
Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

Concurrency is like multitasking and jumping from task to task until they are all done.
Parallelism is more like having an arm for each task and being able to do each task independently at the same time.
